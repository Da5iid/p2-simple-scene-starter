HEIC-1907-A: The Southern Crab Nebula
 
Arguably one of the most beautiful planetary nebulas in the southern hemisphere, the Southern Crab Nebula possesses a unique and beautiful hourglass shape, created by the spinning duo of a white dwarf and red giant.
 
In this "Simple Scene" rendition, I used mostly ellipses to assemble the nebula the best I could. To fill in the visible in between stars, I borrowed and heavily modified a "parallax" demo created by Kevin Workman. In his original version, he breaks down the dots into 3 distinct layers that create an acceptable parallax effect. I removed the limited layers and instead modified it such that the stars fall in any plane they want, creating a much more realistic 3D iteration of a starfield. The user has control over what direction the stars travel using the mouse position. 
 
The star within the starfield iterates randomly and also spawn/despawn when arriving at the borders. Each star also changes size as appropriate to its speed as to help sell the parallax effect. Each star also subtly changes color... Subtly...
